# An assignment on Software Engineering course

## Intro

The navigation of bus in Haikou city. Two modes provided, one for demostrating all the stations of a certain bus line, another for navigation
from start to the end, two shortest path would be provided that, least transfer times and lest stations respectively.

## Details

Graph used for modeling the map, each node represents a station of a bus.
Dijkstra's algorithm used for the problem of shortest path searching.

## Something Else

I programmed in C++ with object-oriented programming for the first time when I was a junior student, while I didn't know how to use the github repository (maybe I don't till now too)
So generally, it was a special experience but there was no any record before except a private and empty repository. 
Based on that, I upload all the source codes on this repository and make it public in 19/09 2024, even if C++ seems to start to being far away from me...
Any way, it is a impressive memory.
